## Testing 

__How testing was done__

- Testing in my local terminal
- Passed code through a PEP8 linter and confirmed there are no problems 
- Given invalid data
    - letters where numbers are expected and the reverse
    - no data entered
    - Blank spaces and random symbols like ! {} []

__Bugs fixed__

- Enteries such as symbols ] , } and empty space caused crashs when code tryed to use it.
  I fixed this by adding list of unexcepted characters.
- Crashed when trying to change non number into int. Fixed by confirming data is number
  before changing to int.
